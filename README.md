# Propeller-LED-Display
LED Display Model which is driven with the help of propeller.

•	Made a display model using only 8 LEDs which makes 8x5 matrix for displaying one English character.
•	For this model, total 17 characters are displayed at a time. (through one complete revolution of motor)
•	AC Series motor is used as a propeller to rotate the LEDs. The speed of motor decides the ON/OFF switching rate of LEDs. That can be calculated by calculating the time of one rotation. (Program execution delay is also taken into the consideration.) 
•	Integrated with Bluetooth to change the display in real-time.
•	The model should be properly mounted with a strong base to avoid vibrations generated due to centrifugal force.
•	The PCB was equally weighed on both sides of the shaft to make the vibrations to a minimum.
